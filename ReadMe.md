## Introduction: Building the "Highly Developed" Community Website with Umbraco 8

In this tutorial, we will build a feature-rich community website called **"Highly Developed"** using **Umbraco version 8**. This project will guide you step-by-step through the process of translating a complete design wireframe into a fully functional Umbraco CMS-powered site.

**"Highly Developed"** is envisioned as an interactive online platform dedicated to realistic training and community engagement. The site features dynamic content areas, member registration and authentication, news publishing, and user profile management. Throughout this tutorial, we will demonstrate best practices for working with Umbraco 8, including document types, templates, custom member management, and interactive content.
